Our collaborative research with [Dr. Juan Alvarez](https://j-radlab.com/) of the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology wins the 2025 [Synergy Grant Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/evdresearch/synergy-grant-program.html) competition. Established in 2019, the Synergy Grant program aims to connect faculty from different domains, through science and innovation. Funded studies demonstrate new synergistic collaboration as well as potential for external funding.
