Dr. Li is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Genetics](https://genetics.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. Before joining Penn Genetics in 2024, he completed his postdoctoral training at Stanford University School of Medicine Department of Genetics with Dr. Jin Billy Li, where he studied the regulation and function of Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing and discovered that immune response caused by insufficient RNA editing is a key genetic driver underlying inflammatory diseases.

Outside the lab, he enjoys biking and playing with his daughter.
